                "It makes the credential look more impressive",
                "It prevents anyone from altering or faking the credential",

            "options": [
                "Because AI automatically checks blockchain records",
                "Because blockchain can prove when and by whom digital content originated, even if AI tries to manipulate it",
                "Because blockchain replaces all forms of AI",

                "They’re stored in one secure corporate database",
                "No single company or organization controls the records, so credentials remain accessible even if a provider shuts down",
                "Each university must host its own blockchain from scratch",
                "They can only be viewed through a special app"
